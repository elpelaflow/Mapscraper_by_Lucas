SerpApi manages the intricacies of scraping and returns structured JSON results. Search Engines constantly experiment with new layouts, new elements, and other changes. We do all the work to maintain all of our parsers and adapt them to respond to changes quickly. By taking care of this for you, we eliminate a lot of time and complexity from your workflow.

We are a subscription-based company, and we offer a wide variety of plans. You can view all of our self-serve plans by registering a free account at serpapi.com and checking the following link:
